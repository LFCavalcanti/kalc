# KALC - Not so simple calculator using React written in TypeScript
This is a personal project to practice React. Instead of building the common calculator projects I decided to include more operations like factorial, radic, etc. Also implemented a formula calculation instead of one math operation at a time.
Another choice was to use Vite instead of CRA to learn it's ins and outs.
